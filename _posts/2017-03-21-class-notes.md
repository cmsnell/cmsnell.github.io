We warmed up by running repping out the torreando to leg drag position, no follow through, just, left, right, left, right, left, right, etc. Then we worked on finishing the pass from leg drag. I need to work on keeping my open side foot back, and pinching more on their hip with that knee.  
 
We then worked on passing DLR. Get up on your toes on the hooked leg, and rotate your foot so your knee is pointing out. Pop the knee straight to clear that hook, then push your knee behind their knee to prevent them from re-hooking. Grip the nearside lapel with the hand on the now hookless side, and drop that knee to the ground and backstep with the other leg. Switch your hips back over and now youâ€™re in side control. You can also keep the grip on the lapel and grab the outside (near side) of his near knee, and deadlift up to turn him away (helpful if he tries to shrimp away).
